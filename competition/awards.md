## [Dean's List Award](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/deans-list-winners)

In an effort to recognize the leadership and dedication of _FIRST_’s most outstanding secondary school students, the Kamen family sponsors awards for selected 10th or 11th grade\* students known as the _FIRST_ Robotics Competition® and the _FIRST_ Tech Challenge _FIRST_ Dean’s List Award. Since its introduction in 2010, the _FIRST_ Dean’s List Award has attracted the attention of prestigious colleges and universities who desire to recruit _FIRST_ Dean’s List students.

Similar to the very prestigious National Merit Scholarship Award, there are three \(3\) levels of _FIRST_ Dean’s List Award students.

* _**FIRST**_ **Dean’s List Semi-finalists** – comprised of the two \(2\) students in their 10th or 11th school year\* nominated by each team.
* _**FIRST**_ **Dean’s List Finalists -** comprised of the two \(2\) students selected at each _FIRST_ Robotics Competition Regional or _FIRST_ Robotics Competition District Championship \(the Qualifying Events\).
  * _Note:_ At _FIRST_ Robotics Competition District Championships, more than two \(2\) students may be selected, depending on the size of the district.
* _**FIRST**_ **Dean’s List Winners** - comprised of the ten \(10\) _FIRST_ Robotics Competition and ten \(10\) _FIRST_ Tech Challenge students selected from the applicable _FIRST_ Dean’s List Finalists at the _FIRST_ Championship.

Each team is invited to select up to two \(2\) students who are in the 10th or 11th grade \(sophomores or juniors\) as _FIRST_ Dean's List Semi-Finalists. The students who earn _FIRST_ Dean’s List Award status as a Semi-Finalists, Finalist or Winner, are great examples of student leaders who have led their Teams and communities to increased awareness for _FIRST_ and its mission. These students have also achieved personal technical expertise and accomplishment. It is the intention of _FIRST_ that these individuals will continue on, post-Award, as great leaders, student alumni, and advocates of _FIRST_.

Prestigious colleges have expressed great interest in meeting _FIRST_ Dean’s List’s Award winners and _FIRST_ hopes that each Team will take advantage of the opportunity to nominate the most qualified students as _FIRST_ Dean’s List Nominees!

_Students are nominated by their team mentors. Celebrate your Team's top 1 or 2 student leaders by nomination them for the FIRST Dean's List Award.
